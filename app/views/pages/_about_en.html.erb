  Beds of BAUDI are a central piece of every bedroom which adds to harmony, the joy of colors, and pleasing sensations.<br/>
  In our very first collection we provide 11 bed designs which can be enriched with a bed linen set in order to create a unique composition.<br/>
  The beds of BAUDI are made unique with the help of their headboards – a soft panel which is attached to the wall to provide unique aesthetic possibilities.<br/>
